    "### CODAR\n",
    "\n",
    "CODAR is a technology that allows the measurement of surface ocean current velocities at a distance using the Doppler shift of reflected radio waves. The principle of Bragg scattering dictates that virtually all of the radio signal received by a CODAR antenna is being reflected back from ocean waves of a particular wavelength. The reflected signal is Doppler-shifted to higher or lower frequencies, depending on whether the ocean wave is moving, respectively, toward or away from the antenna. In the absence of ocean currents, this Doppler shift gives a measurement of the wave spee. If ocean currents are present, however, the Doppler shift gives a measurement of the wave speed PLUS the speed of the ocean current towards or away from the antenna. Because the speed of deep-water waves is known for a given wavelength, the wave speed can be subtracted from the total measured speed, resulting in a value for the speed of the ocean current alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strait of Georgia CODAR system used by ONC is a 25 MHz model. A radio frequency of 25 MHz corresponds to a radio wavelength of 12 meters, so the CODAR system is sensitive to ocean wavelengths of 6 meter. The equation used in calculating ocean current velocities from the Bragg-scattering signal assume that the ocean waves being measured are \"deep-water\" waves. In other words, their wavelengths are less than twice the water depth. As depth decreases beyong this point, the waves will increasingly take on the character of \"shallow-water\" waves. Thus that for a 25 MHz system, ocean currents measured in water depths of less than 3 meters should be viewd with suspiction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### CODAR stations and combiners\n",
    "\n",
    "Each CODAR systems measures the radial velocities of ocean surface currents, toward and away from the station's attenna. Four stations (VCOL, VION, VGPT, VATK) in the Strait of Georgia  have been placed in locations such that their areas of coverage overlap considerably. In the overlapping regions, it is possible to combine the radial data from at least two stations into total ocean currents. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the strait of Georgia, four antennas have been gradually installed since 2011. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the range of high-frequency radio waves is greatly reduced over fresh water compared to the range over salty, highly-conductive water. For this reason, during the spring freshet (June 2018), when the surface water in the strait of Gerogia is much less sality, less coverage of total ocean current would be expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "The total files organize the data into grids with y,x and time dimensions, while the radials files use arrays for the current data, with dimensions of time and index, where index links the currents to their lat/lon sampling locations. The x,y dimensions are the grid centers relative to the grid origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The radial files from combiner stations will contain data from multiple radials stations; the platform_name variable will supply the station name / call sign (i.e. VION) for each time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data description\n",
    "\n",
    "MAT file data structures and definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes the MAT file structure in detail. HFRProgs's README and code also documents these structures, so only relevant ones will be listed in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Totals**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. U/V: surface current total velocities calculated from the Radials structure\n",
    "2. LonLat,2 vector containing longitude and latitude pairs for each U/V value\n",
    "3. Timestamp: date in number format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data included: June and Nov. 2018 of total vectors in formats of *.mat \n",
